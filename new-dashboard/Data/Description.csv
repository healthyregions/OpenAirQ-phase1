1,CO,"Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is a product of combustion. The primary contributor to CO concentration is the burning of fossil fuels. CO poses health concerns when present in high concentrations, but the concentrations found outside are generally only of concern to certain high-risk populations. The EPA's 8 hour standard for CO concentration is 9 ppm. ","CO measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 3 sensors in the area returned daily CO data in ppm. Each sensor's measures were averaged by quarter and used to generate Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolated surfaces the entire area for each quarter."
2,Pb,Lead (Pb) can enter the air in a number of ways including metal processing and fuel burning. High concentrations of airborne lead can negatively affect several important bodily systems causing everything from neurological issues to cardiovascular diseases to kidney disorders. The EPA's 3 month standard for airborne lead is 0.15 micrograms / cubic meter. ,"Lead measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 9 sensors in the area returned daily lead data in micrograms / cubic meter. Each sensor's measures were averaged by quarter and used to generate Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolated surfaces the entire area for each quarter."
3,NO2,"Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a gas released into the air with the burning of fossil fuels. In addition to causing and exacerbating a number of respiratory ailments, NO2 in the air also reacts with other chemicals to form particulate matter and ozone. The EPA's 1 year standard for NO2 concentration is 53 ppb while the 1 hour standard is 100 ppb. ","NO2 measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 8 sensors in the area returned daily NO2 data in ppb. Each sensor's measures were averaged by quarter and used to generate Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolated surfaces the entire area for each quarter."
4,Ozone,"Ozone (O3) is a gas that, at ground level, can exacerbate a number of respiratory ailments when found in high enough concentration. Cars and industrial processes are two of the major contributors to ground-level ozone concentrations. The EPA's 8 hour standard for ozone concentration is 0.070 ppm.","Ozone measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 22 sensors in the area returned daily ozone data in ppm. Each sensor's measures were averaged by quarter and used to generate Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolated surfaces the entire area for each quarter."
5,PM10,"PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometers. It comes from a number of sources, particularly roads, pollen, and industrial processes. Although less able to deeply penetrate the lungs than PM2.5, short-term PM10 exposure has still been linked to a number of adverse health outcomes. The EPA daily PM10 standard is 150 micrograms per cubic meter. ","PM10 measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 12 sensors in the area returned daily PM10 data. Each sensor's measures were averaged by quarter and used to generate Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolated surfaces the entire area for each quarter."
6,PM2.5,"PM2.5 is fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Due to their small size, PM2.5 are easily inhalable and have been found to cause various cardiovascular disorders as well as other adverse health outcomes. The sources of PM2.5 are complex but include to varying degrees automobiles, factories, and dust. The EPA standard for annual PM2.5 concentrations is 12 micrograms per cubic meter while the daily standard is 35 micrograms per cubic meter.","PM2.5 measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 14 sensors in the area returned daily PM10 data. Each sensor's measures were averaged by quarter and used to generate Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolated surfaces the entire area for each quarter."
7,SO2,Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) enters the atmosphere primarily from the burning of fossil fuels as well as other sources including ore refining and volcanic emissions. SO2 causes and exacerbates a number of respiratory ailments and also reacts with other chemicals to form particulate matter in the air. The EPA's 1 hour standard for SO2 concentration is 75 ppb.,"SO2 measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 10 sensors in the area returned daily SO2 data in ppb. Each sensor's measures were averaged by quarter and used to generate Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolated surfaces the entire area for each quarter."
8,AOD,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD) refers to the extinction of light in the atmosphere by small atmospheric aerosol particles. The relative number of these particles can increase due to both natural processes such as dust storms and wildfires and human-driven processes such as coal burning. In addition to its complex role in climate modelling, AOD has also been found, in some cases, to proxy surface levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The average AOD in the United states is between 0.10 and 0.15. A value of 0.10 and under generally indicates clear skies while one near or around 1 generally indicates haziness. 
and haze. In other words, particles in the atmosphere (dust, smoke, pollution)
can block sunlight by absorbing or by scattering light.",This AOD data comes from Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC)-adjusted MODIS readings (MCD19A2 dataset). The MODIS instrument on NASA's Terra and Aqua Satellites provides daily AOD values at a 10km spatial resolution which is improved to 1km by the MAIAC algorithm. The data was aggregated into quarterly averages from 2014 - 2018. 
9,BRF,"Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) indicates the directional dependence of the reflection of light off of a surface. It can be used to model albedo, the proportion of light reflected off of a surface. Because one of the major influences on BRF is surface height which is susceptible to change based on the presence of buildings, the BRF map clearly indicates the location of the most dense urban areas. ",This BRF data comes from Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC)-adjusted MODIS readings (MCD19A3 dataset). The MODIS instrument on NASA's Terra and Aqua Satellites provides 8-day average . The data was aggregated into quarterly averages from 2014 - 2018 at the same 1km spatial resolution.
10,NDVI,"Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measures the greenness of the surface using the red, near-infrared, and blue bands of remote-sensed imagery. Plants absorb certain wavelengths of radiation while reflecting others, thus allowing NDVI to accurately represent the presence of vegetation. NDVI values fall between -1 and 1, with negative values generally indicating the presence of water and positive values indicating increasingly greener areas as a reading approaches 1. ",This NDVI data comes from the MODIS instrument on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites which provides 16-day NDVI averages at a 250m spatial resolution (MOD13Q1 dataset). This was aggregated into quarterly averages from 2014 - 2018 at a 1km spatial resolution. 
11,Roads,"While no direct measure of road emissions is available for this region, road emissions can be proxied by examining road density. Areas with relatively high road density generally have worse air pollution, especially in terms of airborne particulate matter concentrations. Because road density is being used rather than actual road emissions or traffic volume, extremely minor roads are excluded from consideration as they contribute significantly less to pollution in surrounding areas. ","Road data is from an extract of OpenStreetMap. Roads with “primary”, “secondary”, “tertiary”, “highway”, “motorway” tags were selected in calculating density. The total lengths of these roads in each 1km grid cell was summed up and then divided by the area of each grid cell to provide the meters of road per square meter of each grid cell. "
12,Point Emissions,"Point emissions refer to the collection of industrial facilities, power plants, airports, and commercial facilities that are located at fixed locations and meet the standard of reporting set forth in the Air Emissions Reporting Requirements. These sources are responsible for much of the industrial and non-industrial human-caused pollution and their locations indicate potential areas of high pollution. Due to differing state and local laws, the documented point emissions sources in certain areas may be more complete than others. ",Point emissions data is from the 2014 National Emissions Inventory. The various pollution sources were filtered to those labelled “PM2.5 Primary (Filt + Cond).” The final product is a count of the number of PM2.5 point emissions sources in each 1km grid cell.
13,Temperature,"The relationship between temperature and air quality is quite complex meaning that it is impossible to simply say “Colder temperatures mean that the air quality will be worse” or the opposite. For example, during the winter months, increased use of fuels for heating may increase levels of particulate matter and CO in the atmosphere. On the other hand, higher temperatures can cause heightened levels of NO2 and ozone. ","Temperature data is from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains meteorological data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. Measures from 12 sensors in the area returned daily temperature averages in degrees Fahrenheit calculated as the mean of 24 hourly measurements. Each sensor's measures were averaged by quarter and used to generate Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolated surfaces the entire area for each quarter."

15,Land Cover,"Land cover refers to the specific element covering a given part of the Earth's surface, be it vegetation, water, concrete, or something different. The 584 unique land cover classifications provided were distilled into three colored indices, a green, gray, and blue index. The green index consists of all land cover classifications in the “Agriculture and Developed Vegetation”, “Forest and Woodland”, and “Shrub and Herb Vegetation” classes. The gray index consists of all land cover classifications in the “Developed & Other Human Use” and “Recently Disturbed or Modified” classes. The blue index consists of all land cover classifications in the “Open Water” class",The land cover data comes from the USGS GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems 2011 dataset which provides 584 unique land cover classifications at a 30m resolution. The data was aggregated to a 1km spatial resolution with each value representing the percentage of a 1km tile covered by a given colored index.
16,Elevation,"Elevation is, in this case, generated from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and thus refers to the surface elevation of the Earth's terrain. It represents the height of the bare ground in meters. DEM readings are therefore absent any buildings or other large human constructions. ",The elevation data comes from the USGS 3D Elevation Program's _ arc second (10 m) spatial resolution DEM. This dataset is continuously improved with new tiles as updated data becomes available. The data was aggregated to a 1km spatial resolution with a value representing the average elevation of a given cell.
